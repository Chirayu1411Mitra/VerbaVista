The U.S. will retain the control of its nuclear weapons, and the body's establishment was meant to ease South Korean worries about North Korean nuclear threats.

                    <p>At a recent press conference ahead of the launch of his sequel Indian 2, Kamal Haasan is asked a question that makes his colleagues on stage with him smirk. He's asked if he's upset that though there are three pretty heroines in the film, he himself has no consort. Kamal raises the mic and with great assurance, answers: “My consort in the film does not have to be a woman.” In that one sentence, is buried a touch stone. Kamal, with this, reveals the consummate artist he is, his relationship with cinema, his philosophical approach to the medium, and that while he's celebrated as a hero, his tango with the movies goes far beyond formulae and stereotypes.
